            <h2> Carlo's Pizzaria</h2>
            <p>    Imagine this: you walk into a room and you get a whiff of delicious food; you already know it is going to be a good time. This is what happens every time I walk into Carlos’s pizzeria. Fresh out the oven, the crust is cooked to perfection, not too thin but not too thick either, and on top is the excellent chunky tomato sauce, and it’s served with a heavenly smell that makes anyone want more. It does not compare at all to the millions of cheap “1 dollar pizza” places that you see everywhere in Manhattan. The pizzas that have no sauce, are too cheesy, very flimsy, super small, and not worth their cheap price.</p>
            <p>    Carlos’s Pizzeria, made in 1966, has a classic old timey feel to it, workers talking in their heavy Italian accents, black and white checkered floors, mirrors for the walls, and old fashioned black and turquoise tables and chairs, multiple tv’s broadcasting all types of sports but usually baseball, football, soccer, and basketball, which makes it the perfect place to sit down and grab a bite of their different types of pizzas and sandwiches, their chicken rolls, their wings, garlic knots and rolls, and indulge in a great conversation with family friends or whoever it may be.</p>
            <p>    Anytime I go I see so many different types of people stop by. Little kids anywhere from the ages three through seven talking about their new Hot Wheels car or their new Legos set or their favorite tv show, middle aged men screaming at the tv’s during football and baseball games, teens talking about the newest tik tok trend or talking about whatever they find cool, mothers holding their babies or taking care of their kids, grandpas conversing while playing dominoes, checkers, or chess, grandmas gossiping about all of the drama they hear. And every single time there is a smile on each and every one of their faces. They all don’t regret coming here and they’re fulfilled with the outcomes of staying.</p>
            <p>    Same goes for the ethnicity of the people, people from Europe, especially Russians talking about the soccer game that they are watching. Albanians like myself, cousins, and other friends come here very often. Even one of the workers there is Albanian, he's my dad's friend. My cousins and I always speak with him in Albanian while everyone else is left very confused. And obviously, the Italians come by, the pizza lovers themselves, and when there are a plethora of Italians eating the pizza, then you know it’s top tier, quality food that just can not be beat.</p>
            <p>    Diverse. The one word I would use to describe this pizzeria, the one word; I would use to describe my neighborhood; the one word I would use to describe my New York. This pizzeria has shown me that no matter who you are, the best conversations are made with great food. Carlos’s pizzeria, just like my neighborhood, is very diverse. No matter where I have been, whether it was summers in Montenegro, a place full of only Balkan people, regardless if you were in a tourist hotspot or not, you will almost never see an Asian, African or Latin American person. Or basketball tournaments in Maryland, which were predominantly white people. No place is anywhere near as diverse as New York.</p>
